/**
 * Extract the portal data contract from a project's graph + lock.
 *
 * This is the trust core: every count in `meta.counts` is DERIVED by reusing the
 * CLI's own read-only functions — `runCheck` for severities + coverage, `verifyLock`
 * for per-pair states, `computeExpectedPairs` for the pair denominator — never a
 * literal and never a re-implementation. The acceptance invariant (the count-parity
 * gate) is that `meta.counts.errors/warnings/coveredFiles/totalFiles` equal what
 * `runCheck` reports and `verified + refused + unverified` equals the expected-pair
 * count.
 *
 * Read-only: the graph is loaded committed-only (`noSecrets`), no lock is written,
 * no LLM is called. `generatedAt` is stamped AFTER generation (Date is read here,
 * never inside the pure contract module).
 *
 * Per-node detail, the aspect/flow/type catalogues, the live boundary, hubs,
 * suppression inventory, and the worklist are filled by later derivation steps;
 * this step establishes the counts and the seam.
