New read-only command that inventories every active yg-suppress marker across git-tracked text files and warns on three footguns: a marker naming an aspect id that no longer exists in the graph, a wildcard that silences all current and future checks, and an unbounded disable with no matching enable that leaks suppression to the end of the file. It records no baseline and always exits zero because it is informational, not a gate.

The marker inventory scanned every git-tracked text file, so it reported phantom waivers wherever the suppress syntax merely appears in prose: the generated agent rules file, per-node history logs, the changelog, the README, and documentation pages. None of those are code an aspect verifies, so a mention there can never be an active, reviewer-honored waiver. The scan now skips generated rules mirrors for every supported agent, anything under the graph directory, any per-node history file, and prose or documentation file types, restricting the inventory to files that can carry a genuine code-side waiver. The command stays read-only and always exits success.

The suppressions inventory command was unusable because it reported hundreds of false markers — matches of the marker syntax inside string literals in test and template files. It now routes parseable files through a comment-only scan and keeps the raw line scan only for non-parseable file types, so the listing shows the genuine comment-based waivers instead of drowning them. This corrects only what the inventory reports; which markers are actually honored during review is decided elsewhere and is unchanged.

Delete tree-sitter Tree object after scanning suppression markers.

The tree parsed in the file-scan path was used synchronously to collect suppression markers and then abandoned — the reference went out of scope but the WASM-backed Tree was never freed. Part of the broader WASM heap leak fix: every Tree created outside a managed ParseCache must be explicitly deleted after use to prevent heap exhaustion on large repos.

Fixed WASM tree lifecycle bug in the suppressions scanner.

In scanMarkersForFile, a Tree created by parseFile() had its .delete() call on the happy path only — inside the try block but not in a finally. If scanSuppressionMarkersInComments threw synchronously, the catch block returned the raw-text fallback without ever calling tree.delete(), permanently leaking the WASM Tree object on the heap.

Replaced the manual try/delete pattern with withParsedFile, which wraps the parse operation in a function that guarantees tree.delete() in a finally block regardless of whether the callback throws. The suppression scan falls back to the raw-text scanner on any error from withParsedFile (including parse failures), preserving the original best-effort behavior.
