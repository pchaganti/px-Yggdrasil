/**
 * Resolve a Go import PATH to a repo-relative POSIX `.go` source file, or undefined.
 *
 * A Go import path (`example.com/mod/foo/bar`) names a package DIRECTORY, not a
 * single file. Mapping it to a graph node requires:
 *   (a) the module path from `go.mod` at the module root;
 *   (b) stripping that module prefix from the import path to get the repo-relative
 *       package DIRECTORY;
 *   (c) finding a representative `.go` file in that directory on disk;
 *   (d) handing that file to the owner index downstream.
 *
 * An import path that does NOT start with the module path (a stdlib package like
 * `fmt`/`os`, or an external module) resolves to NO mapped file → undefined. This
 * fail-to-silence is the single most important false-positive guard: only imports
 * under the repo's own module are graph-resolvable; everything else is silent.
 *
 * Dot-imports (`. "pkg"`) and blank imports (`_ "pkg"`) still name a real package
 * path, so the extractor emits the path normally and this resolver treats it like
 * any other — the local-binding form is irrelevant here.
 *
 * Resolution is pure except through `deps`, which provides disk access derived
 * from the project root. The module path is read from go.mod once and cached by
 * the caller (`makeGoResolver`).
