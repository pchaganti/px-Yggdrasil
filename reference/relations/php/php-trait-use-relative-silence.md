## Rule

An in-class trait `use Timestamps;` (or `use Ns\Other;`) is namespace-RELATIVE, unlike
the absolute top-level namespace `use`: in `namespace App` it resolves to `App\Timestamps`
by current-namespace prepend, never global `\Timestamps`. The extractor never reads an
in-class trait `use` (import-only), so it is silent — applying the absolute top-level
rule here would be the T6 mis-bind.

## Files

```php path=src/Mixin/Timestamps.php
<?php
namespace App\Mixin;
trait Timestamps {}
```

```php path=src/Order/Handler.php
<?php
namespace App;
class Handler { use Timestamps; use Ns\Other; }
```

```json path=composer.json
{ "autoload": { "psr-4": { "App\\": "src/" } } }
```

## Expect

- silence      # in-class trait `use` is namespace-relative usage-site → silent; never the global `App\Mixin\Timestamps`

## Why

The in-class trait `use` resolves against the current namespace; treating it like the
absolute top-level import would mis-bind, so it stays silent.
