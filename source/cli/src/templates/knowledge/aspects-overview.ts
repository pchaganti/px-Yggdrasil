export const content = `# Aspects overview

Aspects are enforceable rules attached to nodes. A reviewer (LLM or
deterministic) checks the subject files of a unit against the aspect, and the
verdict is cached in the lock.

## What an aspect is

An aspect pairs a description (\`content.md\` for LLM, \`check.mjs\` for
deterministic) with metadata (\`yg-aspect.yaml\`), and optionally reference files
(LLM aspects only) for supporting context. Verification produces \`approved\` or
\`refused\` with a violation report, stored in \`.yggdrasil/yg-lock.json\` keyed by
the \`(aspect, unit)\` pair.

A verdict holds exactly while the inputs that produced it are unchanged. Editing
a subject file, the aspect's rule source, its \`scope\`, or its tier makes the pair
unverified, and \`yg check --approve\` re-verifies it. A status flip is not an
input — it never invalidates a verdict. (Full mechanics:
\`yg knowledge read verification-and-lock\`.)

For HOW aspects reach a node (the 7 propagation channels with concrete
example), see the SYSTEM section of agent-rules.md — that mental model is
loaded by default and is not duplicated here.

## When to create an aspect

Create an aspect when:
1. The same pattern appears in 3+ files AND
2. A reviewer can verify it against source code

Both conditions must hold. "Code should be readable" fails condition 2.
"Every handler must log an audit trail" satisfies both.

See agent-rules.md "Aspect Discovery" for the brownfield triggers
(repeated patterns, "invisible" cross-cutting concerns) — also not
duplicated here.

While the rule is still being authored or is unclear, give the aspect
\`status: draft\` — a draft aspect produces no expected pairs, so nothing is
verified and it costs zero.

## Scope — node or file

An aspect with a rule source may declare \`scope:\`:

\`\`\`yaml
scope:
  per: node | file        # default: node
  files:                  # optional — file-predicate filter (path/content atoms)
    all_of:
      - path: "src/**/*.ts"
      - not: { path: "**/*.test.ts" }
\`\`\`

- \`per: node\` (default) — one verdict over the whole subject set. Editing a file
  OUTSIDE the filter does not change the subject set, so an irrelevant edit
  (a README, a fixture) leaves the code-rule verdict valid.
- \`per: file\` — one verdict per subject file. Correct only for **file-local**
  rules. Cross-file rules ("exactly one file exports X", "correlation ID
  propagates") must stay \`per: node\`. See
  \`yg knowledge read writing-llm-aspects\`.

A \`scope\` edit (either \`per\` or \`files\`) invalidates EVERY pair of the aspect —
it cascades exactly like a \`content.md\` edit. Run \`yg impact --aspect <id>\`
before changing scope on a widely-used aspect. Aggregating aspects have no rule
source and therefore no \`scope\` (a validator error if present).

## Three reviewer kinds

Three reviewer kinds exist: LLM, deterministic, and aggregating. The kind is
**inferred** from which rule source file is present in the aspect directory:
\`content.md\` → LLM; \`check.mjs\` → deterministic; neither file but \`implies:\`
declared → aggregating. The \`reviewer:\` block in \`yg-aspect.yaml\` is optional;
if present, an explicit \`reviewer.type\` must agree with the inferred kind.

**\`companion.mjs\` is an add-on to the LLM kind, not a fourth reviewer kind.**
An LLM aspect may ship \`companion.mjs\` alongside \`content.md\` to provide a
per-unit companion file resolver — a hook that selects 0..N files injected
into the reviewer prompt for each unit individually. Presence of
\`companion.mjs\` does not change the inferred reviewer kind (still LLM) and
is forbidden alongside \`check.mjs\`. See
\`yg knowledge read writing-llm-aspects\` for the full contract.

### Aggregating aspects

An aggregating aspect ships neither \`content.md\` nor \`check.mjs\`. It exists
purely to bundle other aspects under one named attach point. When an aggregating
aspect is effective on a node, all aspects in its \`implies:\` list are expanded
and verified individually. The aggregate itself has no own reviewer and produces
no own verdict. It never dispatches to an LLM and never runs \`check.mjs\`.

Use aggregating aspects to decompose a multi-rule contract: attach the aggregate
once (per node, per flow, per architecture type) and let each implied child carry
one concrete, independently-verdicted rule. An aspect with neither rule source
and no \`implies:\` is rejected by the validator.

### When to use LLM

Choose LLM (ship a \`content.md\`) when:
- The rule requires judgment ("no business logic in controllers")
- The rule involves semantics ("correlation ID must propagate across calls")
- The rule needs to understand intent rather than syntax
- The rule is hard to express as a structural pattern

LLM reviewers understand context, read prose rules, and can assess whether
code satisfies a nuanced requirement. They are slower and cost per call.

LLM aspects may declare \`reviewer.tier: <name>\` to opt into a specific reviewer
tier configured in \`yg-config.yaml\` (a higher-capability model for critical
aspects). If \`tier:\` is omitted, the aspect uses the tier named by
\`reviewer.default\` (or the sole tier, if only one is configured).

### When to use deterministic

Choose deterministic (ship a \`check.mjs\`) when:
- The rule is structural ("never import from \`db/\` in \`ui/\`")
- The rule is naming-based ("exported classes must be PascalCase")
- The rule is about graph or file-system shape ("every command node must have
  a sibling test file"; "every child of an engine node must be of type
  engine-component")
- You need zero false-positive tolerance and determinism
- The rule is "X must never appear" — forbidden API calls, banned imports

A \`check.mjs\` is one \`check(ctx)\` function: it reads the unit's files and may
reach related nodes, the file system, and graph metadata through \`ctx\`. It runs
locally during \`yg check --approve\` at zero LLM cost and returns exact,
deterministic results. Deterministic aspects do NOT use reviewer tiers —
\`reviewer.tier:\` is rejected on them.

\`check.mjs\` runs in the main Node process with full privileges — there is no
security sandbox. The read allow-list is a discipline that scopes observed
dependencies, not an isolation boundary. Only run aspects you trust.

### Decision tree

1. Can the rule be expressed as "this syntax pattern must (not) appear" or
   "this graph/file-system shape must hold"?
   → Yes: use deterministic
   → No: continue

2. Does the rule require understanding code intent or business logic?
   → Yes: use LLM

3. Is the rule about naming, import paths, structural shape, or cross-node
   consistency?
   → Yes: use deterministic

4. Does the rule need to assess whether semantics match a requirement?
   → Yes: use LLM

When in doubt: write a draft \`check.mjs\`, test it with \`yg aspect-test\`. If it
catches real violations without false positives, ship it as deterministic. If it
misses violations that require reading intent, switch to LLM.

## Cost model

Cost is counted per PAIR.

- An LLM pair = at least one reviewer call during \`yg check --approve\`,
  multiplied by the tier's consensus count. An LLM aspect touching 20 single-unit
  nodes = at least 20 calls. With \`per: file\`, multiply by the subject-file count
  (and references travel in every per-file prompt).
- Deterministic pairs run locally at zero LLM cost, however many they touch.
- Aggregating aspects have no own reviewer call.
- A \`scope\` edit, a \`content.md\` edit, a reference-file edit, or a tier change
  invalidates pairs and re-bills them. Run \`yg impact --aspect <id>\` before
  modifying a widely-used aspect to see the re-verification cost.
- **Editing \`companion.mjs\`** re-verifies ALL pairs of the aspect (like a
  \`content.md\` edit). **Editing a resolved companion file** re-verifies only
  the pairs that observed it (like editing a subject file, not a full re-bill).
  Use \`yg impact --file <companion>\` to see which pairs read a given file.

The prompt-size gate (\`max_prompt_chars\` per tier) bounds an LLM prompt, not the
node. For the full caching, hashing, and merge model:
\`yg knowledge read verification-and-lock\`.

## Aspect status

Aspects declare \`status: draft | advisory | enforced\` (default \`enforced\`).
Status is rendering only — it never changes a verdict's validity.

| Status   | Expected pairs | Renders as |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| draft    | none (removed) | n/a                      |
| advisory | yes            | warning (refused or unverified) |
| enforced | yes            | error — blocks \`yg check\`     |

Advisory never blocks; enforced always does; only \`draft\` removes a pair from the
expected set. Deep reference: \`yg knowledge read aspect-status\`.

## Organizing aspects in directories

An aspect's id is its directory path under the aspects root, so ids can be NESTED:
a rule file at \`<aspects-root>/logging/audit/\` has id \`logging/audit\`. A directory
that holds no rule file is a pure organizational GROUPER — it just namespaces the
aspects beneath it. Use this to keep a growing aspect set legible: group related
rules under a common prefix (\`logging/...\`, \`security/...\`) instead of a flat pile
of top-level ids, nesting as deep as the structure warrants.

Directory nesting is NAMING only — it does NOT create inheritance or a cascade
between aspects. A child-directory aspect does not inherit its parent directory's
rules; cascade comes from the NODE hierarchy and the attach channels, never from
where an aspect's files sit. When several aspects share a theme or attach point,
prefer grouping them in a directory (and, for a multi-rule contract behind one
name, an aggregating aspect) over leaving them scattered.

## Positive and negative aspects

An aspect can require something to BE present (positive — "every public handler
validates its input") or forbid something from being present (negative — "no
component reaches the data store directly"). This is purely how the rule file is
worded: an LLM aspect's prose states the prohibition, a deterministic check returns
a violation when the forbidden pattern appears. Both are first-class; neither needs
a special mechanism.

A common, powerful shape is a broad NEGATIVE aspect with a carved-out specialist.
Attach the prohibition at a parent node so it cascades to every descendant, then
EXCLUDE the one node type that is legitimately allowed to do the forbidden thing —
the type that carries its own POSITIVE aspects enforcing that it does so correctly:

\`\`\`yaml
# "no direct data-store access" — everywhere EXCEPT the data-access layer, which
# carries its own aspects ensuring it accesses the store correctly.
when:
  not:
    node:
      type: data-access
\`\`\`

The exclusion is a \`when\` predicate — deterministic, zero reviewer cost. The pattern
is general, not storage-specific: "no raw outbound HTTP except the gateway node",
"no logging-framework bypass except the logging adapter", and so on. Grammar:
