/*
 * Playwright test fixtures (Chromium) for the portal e2e — the shared, torn-down harness.
 *
 * Exposes:
 *   t          — a per-worker Teardown registry; every server/temp-dir created in a test is
 *                tracked here and killed/removed in the worker-scoped afterAll, so a run always
 *                terminates (no orphan server, no leaked browser — Playwright owns the browser).
 *   basicPage  — the file:// URL of the REAL `yg portal --static` page over the frozen
 *                `portal-basic` fixture (the small, exact-count surface).
 *   repoPage   — the file:// URL of the REAL `yg portal --static` page over THIS repo's own
 *                graph through the public CLI (the rich surface: flows, suppressions, hubs,
 *                many types — for the transition rows that need real data). Generated once.
 *
 * All test specs import `test` / `expect` from here, so they share one Chromium project and one
 * teardown. No portal internal is imported; no PortalData is fabricated.

// dependency graph, so it must stay a destructuring pattern; the `use` callbacks are left to
// Playwright's own inference (the canonical worker-fixture form).
