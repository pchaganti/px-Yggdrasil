/**
 * Candidate-group parity (Stage 1 of the unified name-resolution mechanism).
 *
 * The shape change makes each detected reference carry an ORDERED `candidates: TargetHint[]`
 * instead of a single `targetHint`, and the pass walks that list (first-unique-match-wins)
 * instead of resolving one hint. For every PATH-resolved language this MUST be a
 * behaviour-preserving refactor:
 *
 *  (1) every extractor wraps each reference as exactly a ONE-ELEMENT group — no extractor is
 *      silently dropped (a dropped extractor would emit an empty group, turning its edges
 *      off = a recall loss) and none accidentally widens to a multi-element group; and
 *  (2) the ordered walk over a one-element group emits BYTE-IDENTICAL `ResolvedDep`s to the
 *      pre-change per-dep path, which resolved `dep.targetHint` (now `dep.candidates[0]`)
 *      directly via `resolver.resolve`.
 *
 * This test independently re-derives the pre-change behaviour (resolve candidates[0]) and
 * the new behaviour (the ordered classify-walk) over the SAME extractor output and asserts
 * they agree, for representative source in every path-resolved language. A divergence here
 * would mean Stage 1 changed an edge — exactly what it must not do.
