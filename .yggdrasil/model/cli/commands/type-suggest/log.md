Add yg type-suggest --file command: suggests node_type based on architecture when predicates. Shows matching types, closest 3 by satisfied-fraction, or edge-case messages for .yggdrasil/ and non-existent files.

Restructure: loadGraph first, resolve --file via resolveFileArg(repoRoot), fix posix-paths trailing slash strip

R0.3: updated import from utils/repo-scan to io/repo-scanner (no logic change)
## [2026-05-15T12:28:18.002Z]
R0.4: file-content-cache import updated from core to io (no logic change)
## [2026-05-15T12:36:42.834Z]
R0.4b: cascade from cli/io metadata update (atomic-write.ts added to mapping)
## [2026-05-15T12:41:10.616Z]
R0.5: graph-loader.ts now routes all fs calls through io/graph-fs.ts (readSortedDir, readTextFile)

Phase 4.7 (no-direct-fs): update paths import from utils/ to io/ following move of paths module to persistence-adapter layer
## [2026-05-16T06:34:16.259Z]
Phase 5.2 (posix-paths-output): add backslash replacement to repoRelPath normalization
## [2026-05-16T17:37:14.424Z]
Replaced inline 'No .yggdrasil/ directory found' error block with the shared loadGraphOrAbort helper from formatters/cli-preamble.ts. Reason: the same string and exit-1 logic was duplicated across 12 CLI command handlers; centralization eliminates a copy-paste class and routes the missing-graph message through buildIssueMessage uniformly. Other errors continue to flow through the surrounding catch and will be migrated to buildIssueMessage in the next task.
## [2026-05-16T18:22:21.440Z]
Migrated remaining ad-hoc stderr errors to buildIssueMessage (constant-text errors wrapped inline) and routed generic catch-blocks through the new abortOnUnexpectedError helper from formatters/cli-preamble.ts. Reason: even after the loadGraphOrAbort centralization, command-specific errors and option-validation messages bypassed the what/why/next structure; this commit aligns them so the AST aspect added in the next commit can enforce the rule mechanically.
## [2026-05-31T16:03:32.123Z]
Replaced the hand-inlined path-separator normalization with calls to a single shared helper. The same small idiom — convert backslash separators to forward slashes, and in most places also strip a trailing slash — had been copied across many modules, so the normalization rule lived in dozens of places at once and any change to it risked drifting them out of step. Consolidating it behind one well-named helper means the rule lives in exactly one spot and each call site reads by intent instead of by a repeated regex. Behavior is unchanged: the helper bodies are byte-for-byte equivalent to the expressions they replace, and the full test suite passes identically.
