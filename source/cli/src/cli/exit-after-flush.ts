/**
 * Exit after stdout has fully flushed, then let the event loop drain so the
 * process shuts down cleanly. Guards two distinct failure modes:
 *
 * 1. Truncated output. A large report written to a PIPE (an agent capturing
 *    `yg check | grep`, `yg aspect-test` output, `yg impact`, or CI) is buffered;
 *    a bare `process.exit()` terminates before that buffer drains and silently
 *    truncates the output — exactly when it is longest. We wait for the pending
 *    buffer to drain first.
 *
 * 2. Shutdown abort on Windows. The deterministic-check path registers a
 *    node:module customization hook (see ast/loader-hook.ts) so a check.mjs can
 *    import `@chrisdudek/yg/*`. Node runs that hook on a worker thread connected
 *    by a MessagePort — a libuv async handle. Calling `process.exit()` the instant
 *    a command finishes tears the loop down while that handle is still live; on a
 *    Windows debug-assert libuv build (observed on Node 24) that trips
 *    `assert(!(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING))` in src\win\async.c and aborts
 *    with exit 127. Returning to the event loop instead lets Node shut the hook
 *    worker down cleanly and exit on `process.exitCode`.
 *
 * So we set `process.exitCode` and return to the loop rather than forcing the
 * exit. An UNREF'd fallback `process.exit()` preserves the original "never hang
 * on a lingering handle" guarantee: it fires only if some OTHER handle keeps the
 * loop alive past the grace window, and being unref'd it never holds the loop
 * open itself.
 *
 * The returned promise never resolves: callers treat `exitAfterFlush` as terminal
 * — code after `await exitAfterFlush(...)` must not run (e.g. aspect-test.ts relies
 * on it not to fall through into the --files branch). The hung await is harmless;
 * a pending promise is not a libuv handle and does not keep the loop alive.
 *
 * Shared by every command that does a large `process.stdout.write` immediately
 * followed by exit (check, aspect-test, impact). Keep this the single source of
 * the drain-and-exit logic so the fix cannot regress in one command while staying
 * correct in another.
