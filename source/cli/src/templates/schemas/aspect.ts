# Each aspect is a directory under .yggdrasil/aspects/ containing this file
# plus any number of .md content files (for LLM aspects) or a check.mjs
# (for deterministic aspects).
#
# Aspect identifier = relative path from aspects/ to the directory
# (e.g. observability/logging). Aspects can be organized in nested
# directories — the directory structure is for organization only,
# there is no automatic parent-child inheritance between aspects.
#
# The .md content files are what the reviewer checks against source code.
# They should state WHAT must be satisfied and WHY.
