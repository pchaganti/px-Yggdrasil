## Rule

When two nodes each declare a type with the SAME simple name in DIFFERENT namespaces,
a `use` import binds ONLY the namespace it names. `use App\Http\Request;` in a file
whose own namespace is `App\Auth` (which could itself hold an `App\Auth\Request`) is
the EXACT FQN `App\Http\Request` — there is no current-namespace prepend on a `use`
operand and no sibling binding. The bare usage `Request` (which would resolve to the
import or to the sibling) is a usage-site form and is silent, so the import can never
mis-bind to the sibling `App\Auth\Request`.

## Files

```php path=src/Http/Request.php
<?php
namespace App\Http;
class Request {}
```

```php path=src/Auth/Request.php
<?php
namespace App\Auth;
class Request {}
```

```php path=src/Auth/Controller.php
<?php
namespace App\Auth;
use App\Http\Request;
class Controller { function m(Request $r) {} }
```

```json path=composer.json
{ "autoload": { "psr-4": { "App\\": "src/" } } }
```

## Expect

- src/Auth/Controller.php:3 -> node:Http      # `use App\Http\Request` resolves to src/Http/Request.php (node Http), never the sibling src/Auth/Request.php

## Why

The decisive false-positive class: a same-simple-name type in another namespace must
NOT be chosen over the imported FQN. The exact dotted operand rejects it, and the
bare usage adds no edge.
