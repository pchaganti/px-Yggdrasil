title: Nodes
---

A node is how you point a rule at the right code. It groups a set of source files into one component — a module, a service, a library — and gives that component a name in the graph. Rules attach to nodes, so the first step in enforcing anything is drawing the line around what counts as one component: that line is what lets you, your agent, and the reviewer all talk about the same piece of code.

You write nodes as small YAML files under `.yggdrasil/model/`. One file per component.

## A node file

Here is a complete node — a component called `OrderService`:

```yaml
# .yggdrasil/model/orders/order-service/yg-node.yaml
name: OrderService
type: service
description: "Manages order lifecycle: creation, validation, state transitions"

aspects:
  - requires-audit
  - rate-limiting

relations:
  - target: payments/payment-service
    type: calls

mapping:
  - src/orders/
  - src/orders.ts
```

The fields:

- **name** — display name, shown in CLI output.
- **type** — must match a type defined in the architecture file (see [Node types](#node-types-the-architecture-file)). The type decides what rules apply by default and what this component is allowed to connect to.
- **description** — one line on what the component does. It shows in CLI context output and helps your agent understand the component.
- **aspects** — the rules this component must satisfy. Each name points to an aspect under `.yggdrasil/aspects/`. See [Aspects](/aspects).
- **relations** — the other components this one depends on. See [Relations, flows, ports](/relations-flows-ports).
- **mapping** — which source files this node owns.

## Mapping files

`mapping` is the link between the graph and your real code. Each entry is a directory or a file, relative to the repo root:

```yaml
mapping:
  - src/orders/         # directory — owns every file inside, recursively
  - src/orders.ts       # file — exact match
```

Entries also accept minimatch glob patterns: `*` matches within a single path segment, `**` matches across segments. So you can own a slice of a directory without listing files one by one:

```yaml
mapping:
  - src/db/*Repository.ts   # only *Repository.ts directly in src/db/
```

`src/db/*Repository.ts` matches `OrderRepository.ts` but not `Helper.ts` and not anything in a subdirectory. `src/**/*.ts` matches every `.ts` file anywhere under `src/`.

Each source file has exactly one owner node. That rule keeps verification unambiguous — there is always one component, and one set of rules, responsible for any given file.

## Nesting and inheritance

Nodes nest by directory. A node at `model/orders/handler/` is a child of `model/orders/`. Children inherit their parent's aspects: a rule attached to `orders` applies to `orders/handler` and every other node beneath it. Add a rule once at the top of a subtree and it covers the whole subtree.

## Coverage and minimal nodes

You do not have to enforce rules on a component to put it in the graph. When you adopt Yggdrasil on an existing codebase, most of your code is not under enforcement yet — and that is fine. Create a node with a mapping and no aspects:

```yaml
name: LegacyAuth
type: module
description: "Legacy auth — mapped for coverage, no rules yet"
mapping:
  - src/legacy/auth/
```

A node with no aspects produces nothing to verify and nothing to record. It satisfies the coverage requirement for free. The point is to get all your code mapped cheaply, then add rules where they matter, one component at a time. When you are ready to enforce something here, add an aspect to the node.

Coverage — which files must be mapped, and how strictly — is configured separately. See [Configuration](/configuration).

## Node types (the architecture file)

Every node declares a `type`, and every type is defined once in `.yggdrasil/yg-architecture.yaml`. Types are the vocabulary of your architecture. A type can:

- **classify files** — a `when` predicate says which source files belong to this type, so your agent can place new files correctly.
- **set default rules** — list aspects every node of the type must satisfy, so you attach a cross-cutting rule once instead of on every node.
- **constrain structure** — `parents` limits where a node of this type may nest; `relations` limits which types it may depend on, and through which relation type.
- **opt into the log gate** — `log_required: true` makes a change to a node of this type record a short note on *why* before it is verified — your agent writes it with `yg log add` (see the [CLI reference](/cli-reference)).

A compact example:

```yaml
node_types:
  module:
    description: "Business logic unit with a clear domain responsibility"

  service:
    description: "Provides functionality to other components"
    aspects: [requires-audit]       # every service must satisfy this rule
    log_required: true              # service changes carry intent worth recording
    parents: [module]               # a service nests under a module
    relations:
      calls: [service, library]     # a service may call services and libraries
      uses: [library]
    when:
      path: "src/**/*.service.ts"   # files that make a node a "service"

  library:
    description: "Shared utility code with no domain knowledge"
    when:
      path: "src/shared/**"
```

A type with a `when` predicate classifies files. A type without `when` is organizational — usable as a parent in the hierarchy, but its nodes cannot map any files. The `when` grammar (path and content matching, `all_of` / `any_of` / `not`) is the same one used for [conditional aspects](/conditional-aspects); read that page for the full grammar.

The architecture file is the foundation of the graph, so changes to it ripple across every node of the affected type. Change it deliberately, and confirm the change before applying it.

## A note on prompt size

Keep nodes a sensible size, because a component's files all reach the LLM reviewer in one prompt. When the reviewer is an LLM, all of the component's subject files go to it together with the rule, so a bigger node means a bigger prompt. A reviewer tier in `yg-config.yaml` sets `max_prompt_chars` as the ceiling; if an assembled prompt would exceed it, `yg check` reports `prompt-too-large` instead of letting the oversized pair through. The usual fix is to split an oversized node into smaller ones, or narrow which files a rule reviews. Deterministic checks read files directly and have no prompt, so this never applies to them. See [Configuration](/configuration).
