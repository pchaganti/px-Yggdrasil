Provide one shared home for turning a resolver hook's returned paths into prompt-ready companion files: normalise paths to the repo root, drop any path that is already the subject, enforce the reachable-reads boundary, and read the bytes. The review fill and the aspect diagnostic share this single implementation so a path that resolves in the preview resolves identically when the review actually runs; divergence would make the preview lie.

Now hosts the shared per-pair companion resolver so both the approve path and the read-only size gate resolve companions the same way — one hook run with the inconsistent-observation retry guard followed by descriptor resolution. It still never calls a reviewer and never mutates the lock.
