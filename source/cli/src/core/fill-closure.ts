/**
 * Positive closure (spec §7 step 5 / §9). For every node, reconcile its
 * `yg-lock.logs.json` entry:
 *
 * NON-log_required nodes — the source fingerprint is the log gate's drift basis,
 * and the gate never runs for them, so recording it would be dead data that churns
 * the committed logs lock on every source change. Such a node is reconciled to its
 * MINIMAL entry: just the append-only log baseline when it owns a log.md (history
 * integrity is independent of log_required), never a source fingerprint, and no
 * entry at all when it has no log.md. A stale source fingerprint left by an earlier
 * CLI version is stripped; an existing log baseline is preserved even if the log.md
 * vanished, so a deleted log is still caught as an integrity violation.
 *
 * log_required nodes — for a node with a missing/stale source fingerprint, advance
 * its fingerprint + log baseline IFF, AT THE END OF THIS RUN, ALL of the following
 * hold:
 *
 *   (a) the node was NOT log-gate-blocked this run (blockedNodes), AND
 *   (b) the node is not blocked by the mandatory-log gate when re-checked here —
 *       this catches a drifted log_required node that never entered the run's
 *       nodeSet (its source change touched only scope/binary-excluded files, so
 *       it produced zero unverified pairs and step 4 never saw it), AND a drifted
 *       log_required node with ZERO enforced pairs (which must NOT vacuously
 *       close without a fresh entry), AND
 *   (c) every ENFORCED effective pair of the node is approved AGAINST CURRENT
 *       INPUTS — i.e. its post-fill verifyLock state is `verified` (a valid entry
 *       carrying an approved token). A pair that is merely stored-`approved` but
 *       is currently `unverified` (inputs changed, not re-verified this run),
 *       `refused`, or `prompt-too-large` does NOT count.
 *
 * INVARIANT: the closure decision NEVER reads lock.verdicts[...].verdict
 * directly. Fresh validity is sourced from a single post-fill verifyLock pass —
 * the authoritative per-pair classification for THIS run — so a stale-but-stored
 * approved token can never advance a fingerprint over code the run did not
 * actually verify (false-green of both the verdict and the §9 log gate).
 *
 * Advisory refusals never block closure (they are not enforced pairs). A
 * log_required node with no enforced pairs at all closes vacuously ONLY when
 * (a)+(b) also hold — for a drifted log_required node that means a fresh log entry
 * is required. Mapping-less log_required nodes have no source fingerprint; their
 * log baseline is still recorded at closure if a log.md exists (spec §9).
