# Meta-modeling

Most of your graph models your **application** — its components, the rules they must
satisfy, the relations between them. Meta-modeling turns the same machinery on the
graph's OWN rule files: the deterministic checks, rule documents, and definitions
under the `.yggdrasil/` directory. Map them into the graph and you can verify the
rules the way you verify everything else — the rules reviewing the rules.

The motivating shape is a feedback loop: a requirements document names the check
meant to enforce it, and a rule reads that check and judges whether it actually does
what the requirement says.

## It's allowed, and opt-in

Pointing a component's file mapping at a path under `.yggdrasil/` is allowed — the
only mapping restriction is that a mapped path can't escape the repository. And
because the graph directory is excluded from the "uncovered files" scan, you can
model a few rule files without the coverage check demanding you model the rest.
Meta-modeling is partial by design.

## Four ways a rule file reaches a reviewer

1. **Mapping** — map the file to a component and it becomes a reviewed file there.
2. **Static reference** — list it under a rule's `references:` and its contents ride
   every prompt for that rule. References need no mapping and no relation.
3. **Companion (per unit)** — a `companion.mjs` hook returns a different file per
   unit, so each requirement document can pull in the specific check it names. A
   companion-returned file must be reachable from the reviewed component (its own
   files, a declared relation's target, an ancestor, or a descendant).
4. **Deterministic read** — a deterministic check may read a reachable rule file
   through its context object (same reachability rule as a companion).

References (2) need no graph wiring; companion (3) and deterministic reads (4) need
the target reachable, which for a graph-directory file means mapping it and declaring
a relation to its component.

## Consequences — read before you map

Mapping rule files makes them first-class citizens, with the obligations that brings:

- The built-in relation check parses your mapped check code; a check that imports
  another component's code needs that relation declared, or it's refused.
- Every rule effective on the component now reviews those rule files too — choose the
  component's type deliberately and use [conditional rules](/conditional-aspects) so a
  code rule doesn't fire on a Markdown rule file.
- A rule that reviews another rule means editing one re-checks both — keep the meta
  layer small and targeted.
- **Never map the whole `.yggdrasil/` directory.** A broad glob would sweep in the
  committed verdict lock, which changes on every approval and would never settle. Map
  narrowly — name the specific rule files you mean.

## Keeping the blast radius small

Map narrowly; attach the meta rule on the narrowest component that owns the files it
judges, not a broad parent that would cascade everywhere; and use
[conditional rules](/conditional-aspects) to target exactly the units you mean. Rule
ids can be nested in directories, so a meta layer can live under its own prefix and
stay legible — see [Aspects](/aspects).
