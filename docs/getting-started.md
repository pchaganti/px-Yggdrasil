title: Getting Started

Install, point Yggdrasil at one file, and watch the reviewer enforce a rule you wrote. About five minutes.

:::

## 1) Install

Requires Node.js 22+.

```bash
npm install -g @chrisdudek/yg
```

## 2) Init

```bash
cd your-project
yg init
```

The wizard asks two things:

1. **Which AI coding platform?** (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
   This installs a rules file that teaches your agent the Yggdrasil protocol.
2. **Which reviewer provider?** The reviewer verifies your code against your
   rules. If you already run an agent CLI — **Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini
   CLI** — pick it: it needs **no API key** and adds no separate API bill, and
   the wizard just checks the tool is on your PATH. That is the default, and the
   fastest way to start. Ollama runs locally with no API cost. The API providers
   (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) need a key — for those, the wizard fetches the
   available models, lets you pick one, validates the connection, and stores the
   key in `.yggdrasil/yg-secrets.yaml` (automatically gitignored; you can set it
   via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` instead).

The wizard creates `.yggdrasil/` with config, architecture defaults, and the
rules file for your platform.

::: tip No terminal? (Docker, devcontainer, CI)
Bootstrap a fresh graph non-interactively with flags instead of prompts:

```bash
yg init --platform claude-code --provider claude-code --model haiku
```

`--model` is required (init applies no default). Pass `--endpoint` for Ollama or
an OpenAI-compatible provider. API keys are read from the provider's env var.
:::

The architecture file (`.yggdrasil/yg-architecture.yaml`) ships with an empty
architecture (`node_types: {}`) and commented examples — node types are defined
per project, not pre-configured. You add the types your project needs: define
new types, set default aspects per type, constrain relations. Tell the agent to
do it:

> "Add a node type 'api' with a default aspect 'requires-auth'."

## 3) Your first aspect

After init, you have an empty graph, and `yg init` starts you in "require
nothing" mode (`coverage.required: []` in `yg-config.yaml`). So your first
`yg check` is **green** — every file shows up as a non-blocking warning, not a
blocking error:

```text
$ yg check

yg check: PASS (1 warning)  0 nodes · 0/50 files (0%) · 0 aspects · 0 flows

Warnings (1):

  uncovered (50)
            src/…  (every file, listed)
            Why: Not under a coverage.required root — visible but non-blocking. Bring an area under graph coverage to enforce it.
            Fix: Map these files to a node, or add their root to coverage.required to make this an error.
```

Nothing is enforced yet — the warnings are your to-do list. Tell your agent to
create the first rule.

Example prompt:

> "Every service that handles payments must emit audit events.
> Create an aspect for this and apply it to the payments module."

The agent will create:

```text
.yggdrasil/
  aspects/
    requires-audit/
      yg-aspect.yaml       ← name + description
      content.md            ← the actual rule (plain Markdown)
  model/
    payments/
      yg-node.yaml          ← maps src/payments/, lists requires-audit aspect
```

Now run `yg check`:

```text
$ yg check

my-project — 1 nodes, 1 aspects, 0 flows
Coverage: 1/1 source files (100%)

Errors (1) in 1 group:

  unverified — requires-audit (1 node)
    payments  [src/payments/]
    This pair has never been verified. Next: yg check --approve

yg check: FAIL  Errors: 1  Warnings: 0
```

Check detected that the `requires-audit` rule on `src/payments/` has no recorded
verdict. The agent runs `yg check --approve` and the reviewer reads the source
code, checks it against the rules in `content.md`, and reports:

```text
$ yg check --approve

Filling 1 unverified pair across 1 node — 0 deterministic (no cost), 1 reviewer call.

  payments / requires-audit — SATISFIED

Result: PASS (verdict recorded in the lock)
```

If the code didn't satisfy the aspect, the output would show:

```text
  payments / requires-audit — REFUSED
    chargeCard() does not emit an audit event.
    No call to auditLog.emit() found in any mutation path.

Result: FAIL — fix the violation, then re-run: yg check --approve
```

The agent fixes the code and re-runs `yg check --approve` until all aspects pass.

::: tip Start new aspects at `status: advisory`
A brand-new aspect on an existing codebase often surfaces violations across many files. Authoring it as `status: advisory` runs the reviewer and lists refusals as warnings, without blocking CI. Once the rule has been exercised across the repo and the warnings are clean (or knowingly accepted), promote to `status: enforced`. See [Aspect Status](/aspect-status) for the full lifecycle.
:::

## 4) Existing codebase (brownfield)

`yg init` writes `coverage.required: []` — "require nothing" — so a fresh repo
of any size is **green from the first check**, with every unmapped file shown as
a non-blocking warning. You tighten coverage as you go: add a path prefix to
`coverage.required` in `yg-config.yaml` (e.g. `- src/payments/`) and files under
it become blocking errors until they belong to a node; files outside required
(and not excluded) stay non-blocking warnings; files under `coverage.excluded`
are silent. Subtrees with their own nested `.yggdrasil/` are auto-skipped. See
[Configuration](/configuration) for details.

::: info Whole-repo default
An _absent_ coverage block — or a repo initialized before this became the
default — requires the **whole** repo (every file is a blocking error until
mapped). Add an explicit `coverage: { required: [], excluded: [] }` to opt into
require-nothing.
:::

The fast path: **minimal nodes (no aspects) for everything you're not working
on, proper nodes with aspects for what you are.**

Tell your agent:

> "Create nodes without aspects for: src/legacy/, lib/, scripts/. Then create
> a proper node for src/payments/ with the requires-audit aspect."

Nodes without aspects are cheap — just a `yg-node.yaml` with a directory
mapping. They produce no pairs, so there is nothing to verify and nothing
to record. They count as covered for free.

When you start working on a covered area, add aspects to enforce rules.
This is how coverage naturally expands into enforcement as you work.

Practical steps for a 200-file repo:

1. Create 5-8 nodes without aspects for broad directory mappings
2. Create 1-2 nodes with aspects for your active work area
3. Run `yg check --approve` (aspect-less nodes produce no pairs, so the
   only cost is the reviewer pairs on your active work area)
4. `yg check` passes — CI is green
5. Add aspects to more nodes as you touch more code

## 5) CI integration

Add `yg check` to your CI pipeline. It recomputes the input hash of every
expected pair and compares it against the verdict recorded in the lock — no
LLM calls, no provider keys, runs instantly. Exit code 1 means a pair changed
without being re-verified.

The lock's deterministic verdicts live in a gitignored local cache
(`.yg-lock.deterministic.json`), so a fresh CI checkout starts without them and
`yg check` would report those pairs as unverified. Rebuild the cache first — it's
free and needs no key — with `yg check --approve --only-deterministic`, which fills
only the deterministic pairs and writes only the gitignored cache. See
[The lock](/the-lock) for the file layout.

**GitHub Actions:**

```yaml
- name: Rebuild the deterministic cache (free, no keys)
  run: npx @chrisdudek/yg check --approve --only-deterministic
- name: Check architecture
  run: npx @chrisdudek/yg check
```

If check fails, it means a pair's inputs changed without being re-verified.
Tell the agent: "resolve all yg check issues" and it will run `yg check
--approve`, fix violations, and re-verify until check passes.

## 6) Core vs. advanced — what to learn when

Yggdrasil has a lot of surface area, but you only need a few ideas to be
productive. Learn the rest the day you actually need it.

**Core — everything above this point.** Four concepts carry day-to-day work:

- **Node** — maps a set of source files (a `yg-node.yaml` with a `mapping:`).
- **Aspect** — one enforceable rule (`content.md` for the LLM reviewer, or
  `check.mjs` for a deterministic one).
- **`yg check`** — the gate. By default hash-only, no LLM, no keys, runs in CI.
  Red until every changed pair is re-verified. (If `auto_approve` is set in
  `yg-config.yaml`, bare `yg check` may fill pairs automatically — see
  [Configuration](/configuration#auto-approve-config). CI scripts always use
  explicit flags and are unaffected.)
- **`yg check --approve`** — verifies the unverified pairs (deterministic for
  free, then LLM) and records the verdicts in the lock so check goes green.

Plus aspect **status** (`draft` → `advisory` → `enforced`) to control whether a
rule blocks. That is enough to enforce real rules on a real codebase.

**Advanced — reach for these only when a rule needs to scale past one node.**
Aspect inheritance through the node hierarchy, architecture type-defaults,
`implies` chains, flows, ports, and conditional `when` predicates all exist for
one purpose: applying a rule to many nodes **without** copy-pasting it onto each
one. You do not need any of them to start. When "every X must do Y" spans more
than a handful of files, that is the signal to read
[How it works](/how-it-works) and adopt one of these mechanisms.

**You never trace the cascade by hand.** No matter how many of those mechanisms
are in play, you do not work out which rules apply to a file by reading the
graph yourself. Ask the tool:

```bash
yg context --file src/payments/charge.ts
```

It prints every aspect effective on that file, **where each one came from**
(its own node, an ancestor, the architecture type, a flow, a port, or an
`implies` edge), and the `read:` path to each rule's text. The graph computes
the cascade; you read the answer. `yg context --node <path>` does the same from
a node's point of view.
