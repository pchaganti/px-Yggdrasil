/**
 * source/cli/src/core/pairs.ts
 *
 * Read-side foundation for the verdict lock: computes the expected set of
 * (aspect, unit) pairs for a loaded graph and per-node source fingerprints.
 *
 * Public contract (consumed by future check/fill stages):
 *   computeExpectedPairs   — expected pairs for the whole graph
 *   computeSourceFingerprint — sha256 fold over sorted [path, sha256(bytes)] of
 *                              all mapped files (child carve-out applied, binaries
 *                              included by bytes). Format: "path:hash\n..." lines
 *                              sorted, folded with sha256 via hashString.
 *
 * Design:
 *   - scope applies AFTER the 7-channel effectiveness walk, never inside it.
 *   - Aggregate aspects are always excluded (no own reviewer, no own verdict).
 *   - Draft aspects are excluded by default; pass { includeDraft: true } for GC.
 *   - LLM subject sets exclude binary files (by extension); deterministic keeps them.
 *   - Empty subject set → no pair for that (aspect, node) — vacuous pass.
 *   - Nodes with empty mapping → no pairs at all.
 *   - Pairs are sorted by aspectId, then unitKey for deterministic output.
